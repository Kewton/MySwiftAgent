# MySwiftAgent Project Overview

## Purpose
MySwiftAgent is a lightweight personal AI agent/LLM workflow system designed for quick and flexible responses with modular extensibility. The project currently contains two main components:

1. **MyScheduler** - A scheduling system
2. **JobQueue** - A FastAPI-based HTTP API job queue with async execution and persistence

## Key Features
- âš¡ Swift: Lightweight operation with flexible responses
- ðŸ§© Extensible: Modular functionality addition
- ðŸŽ¯ Personalized: User-customizable for specific purposes
- ðŸ”„ Workflow-oriented: LLM-centric flexible workflow design

## Current Focus
The project is currently working on the JobQueue component, which allows arbitrary HTTP API calls to be executed as jobs with async execution, persistence, and monitoring capabilities.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Framework**: FastAPI for web API
- **Database**: SQLite with aiosqlite for async operations
- **Package Management**: uv (modern Python package manager)
- **Testing**: pytest with asyncio support
- **Code Quality**: Ruff (linting + formatting), MyPy (type checking)
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
